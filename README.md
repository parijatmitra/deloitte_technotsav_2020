The Telegram bot detected the disease of a plant when a user uploaded an
image of the leaf of the affected plant. The telegram bot also gave the
required remedies(symptoms,cause,management) to the user. The project was designed on IBM cloud using
IBM cloud services. The diseases were detected by Visual Recognition Model and the remedies were given
by Watson Assistant(chat bot).
